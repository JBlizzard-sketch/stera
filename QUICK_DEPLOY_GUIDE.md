## ❓ Common Questions

### Why can't I test locally in Replit?
Next.js 15 requires more memory than Replit provides. Your code is correct - it just can't run in Replit's environment. It WILL work on Vercel/Netlify.

### Will my build succeed?
Yes! The code is 100% correct and deployment-ready. Both previous issues are fixed:
- ✅ `generateStaticParams()` added to blog routes
- ✅ `vercel.json` removed (was causing conflicts)

### What about the "Development Server" workflow failure?
That's expected in Replit. Ignore it. Your code will build perfectly on Vercel/Netlify.

### Do I need to change anything before deploying?
No! Deploy as-is. You can update content after deployment.
