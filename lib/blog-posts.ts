# Understanding Your Prescription

When your doctor writes a prescription, it contains important information about your medication. Understanding how to read and interpret your prescription can help ensure you take your medication safely and effectively.

## Key Components of a Prescription

### 1. Patient Information
Your prescription should include your full name, date of birth, and sometimes your address. Always verify this information is correct.

### 2. Medication Name
Prescriptions include both the brand name and generic name of the medication. Generic medications contain the same active ingredients as brand-name drugs but are usually less expensive.

### 3. Dosage and Strength
This tells you how much of the medication to take. For example, "500mg" means each dose contains 500 milligrams of the active ingredient.

### 4. Directions for Use
This section explains:
- How often to take the medication
- When to take it (with food, before bed, etc.)
- How long to continue the treatment

## Common Abbreviations

- **QD** - Once daily
- **BID** - Twice daily  
- **TID** - Three times daily
- **PRN** - As needed
- **PO** - By mouth

## Important Safety Tips

1. Always read the label carefully before taking medication
2. Never share prescription medications with others
3. Complete the full course of antibiotics, even if you feel better
4. Store medications according to the instructions
5. Check expiration dates regularly

## Questions to Ask Your Pharmacist

- What is this medication for?
- How should I take it?
- Are there any foods or other medications I should avoid?
- What should I do if I miss a dose?
- What are the possible side effects?

At STERA Pharmacy, our licensed pharmacists are always available to answer your questions and provide guidance on your medications.

# Boost Your Immune System Naturally

A strong immune system is your body's best defense against infections and diseases. While no supplement or lifestyle change can prevent illness entirely, these evidence-based strategies can help support your immune function.

## Nutrition for Immunity

### Essential Vitamins and Minerals

**Vitamin C**
- Found in: Citrus fruits, bell peppers, strawberries, broccoli
- Benefits: Supports white blood cell production
- Daily needs: 75-90mg for adults

**Vitamin D**
- Found in: Fatty fish, fortified milk, sunlight exposure
- Benefits: Regulates immune response
- Daily needs: 600-800 IU for adults

**Zinc**
- Found in: Meat, shellfish, legumes, seeds
- Benefits: Essential for immune cell development
- Daily needs: 8-11mg for adults

## Lifestyle Factors

### 1. Quality Sleep
Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night. During sleep, your body produces and releases cytokines, proteins that help fight infection and inflammation.

### 2. Regular Exercise
Moderate exercise can boost your immune system by promoting good circulation, which allows immune cells to move through your body more effectively.

### 3. Stress Management
Chronic stress can suppress your immune response. Try:
- Meditation or mindfulness
- Yoga or tai chi
- Deep breathing exercises
- Regular breaks and relaxation

### 4. Hydration
Water helps your body produce lymph, which carries white blood cells and other immune system cells. Aim for 8-10 glasses daily.

## Supplements for Immune Support

At STERA Pharmacy, we offer a wide range of immune-supporting supplements:

- Vitamin C tablets and effervescents
- Vitamin D3 supplements
- Zinc lozenges
- Probiotics for gut health
- Multivitamins with immune support

**Important:** Always consult with a healthcare professional before starting new supplements, especially if you take medications or have underlying health conditions.

## Foods That Support Immunity

1. **Citrus fruits** - Vitamin C
2. **Red bell peppers** - More vitamin C than citrus
3. **Broccoli** - Vitamins A, C, and E
4. **Garlic** - Allicin compounds
5. **Ginger** - Anti-inflammatory properties
6. **Spinach** - Antioxidants and beta carotene
7. **Yogurt** - Probiotics for gut health
8. **Almonds** - Vitamin E
9. **Turmeric** - Curcumin compound
10. **Green tea** - Antioxidants

## When to See a Doctor

While supporting your immune system naturally is important, seek medical attention if you:
- Have a fever above 103°F (39.4°C)
- Experience severe symptoms
- Have a weakened immune system
- Symptoms persist or worsen

Visit STERA Pharmacy for personalized advice on immune support supplements and strategies tailored to your health needs.
